Ansible Variables, Dictionaries, and Facts - Beginner Study Material
What are Ansible Variables?
Variables in Ansible are used to store values that can change dynamically during execution. These values can include strings, numbers, lists, and dictionaries. Variables help make playbooks more flexible and reusable.
Rules for Ansible Variables:
â€¢	Variables can contain letters, numbers, or underscores (_).
â€¢	Variables must start with a letter.
â€¢	Variables are case-sensitive.
â€¢	Variables can be defined in multiple ways: 
o	Inside playbooks.
o	In separate variable files.
o	In inventory files.
o	As command-line arguments.
Example of Variables in Ansible:
---
vars:
  username: "JohnDoe"
  age: 30
  country: "USA"
What is an Ansible Dictionary?
A dictionary in Ansible is a collection of key-value pairs. It allows multiple related variables to be stored together.
Example of a Dictionary in Ansible:
---
vars:
  user:
    name: "Alice"
    age: 25
    city: "New York"
Accessing Dictionary Values:
To access dictionary values in a playbook:
- name: Display user details
  debug:
    msg: "User's name is {{ user.name }} and age is {{ user.age }}"
What are Ansible Facts?
Ansible facts are system information that Ansible gathers automatically when executing a playbook. Facts provide details about the target host, such as:
â€¢	Operating System
â€¢	IP Address
â€¢	Memory and Disk Usage
â€¢	Hostname
Facts are useful when you need to perform tasks conditionally based on the system's state.
Example: Using Ansible Facts
- name: Display system information
  debug:
    msg: "The system has {{ ansible_processor_vcpus }} CPU cores and {{ ansible_memory_mb.real.total }} MB RAM."
Using Ansible Facts in Conditions
Facts can be used in conditional statements to execute tasks based on system properties.
Example: Running a Task on Specific OS
- name: Install Apache on Ubuntu
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
  when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
This ensures that Apache is installed only on Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu).

# Ansible Variables - A Beginner's Guide
What are Ansible Variables?
Ansible variables allow you to store and reuse values across your playbooks. They help make configurations flexible and manageable. Variables can store information like usernames, passwords, environment names, and file paths.
Rules for Defining Variables:
â€¢	Must start with a letter.
â€¢	Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
â€¢	Case-sensitive.
â€¢	Should be defined in a structured manner.
Defining Variables in Ansible
1. Defining Variables in a Playbook
Variables can be defined inside a playbook under the vars section.
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    environment_name: "development"
  tasks:
    - name: Display the environment variable
      debug:
        msg: "The environment is {{ environment_name }}"
2. Defining Variables in a Separate File
Variables can be stored in a separate YAML file and included in the playbook.
# vars.yml
environment_name: "production"
Then, include it in your playbook:
- hosts: localhost
  vars_files:
    - vars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Display the environment variable
      debug:
        msg: "The environment is {{ environment_name }}"
3. Defining Variables in the Inventory File
You can define variables in the inventory file under host_vars or group_vars.
[webservers]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 environment_name=staging
Using Variables in Tasks
You can reference variables using double curly braces ({{ variable_name }}).
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    environment_name: "testing"
  tasks:
    - name: Create a file using a variable
      file:
        path: "{{ environment_name }}_config.txt"
        state: touch
Using Variables in Templates
Ansible allows using variables in Jinja2 templates. Below is an example template file (config.j2):
Environment: {{ environment_name }}
Application Name: {{ app_name }}
You can deploy it using a task:
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    environment_name: "production"
    app_name: "MyApp"
  tasks:
    - name: Deploy configuration file
      template:
        src: config.j2
        dest: /etc/myapp/config.txt
Loops and Conditional Statements with Variables
Looping Through a List
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    users:
      - alice
      - bob
      - charlie
  tasks:
    - name: Create user directories
      file:
        path: "/home/{{ item }}"
        state: directory
      loop: "{{ users }}"
Using Variables in Conditions
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    os_type: "Ubuntu"
  tasks:
    - name: Install software only on Ubuntu
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: os_type == "Ubuntu"
Why Use Variables?
Feature	Benefit
Reusability	Avoids repetition of values in playbooks
Maintainability	Centralized management of values
Flexibility	Easily switch configurations for different environments
Scalability	Helps manage a large number of hosts efficiently
Conclusion
Using variables in Ansible makes automation more efficient and manageable. By defining variables in playbooks, inventory files, or separate files, you can create flexible and reusable automation scripts.

Next Steps:
â€¢	Try creating a playbook that uses variables.
â€¢	Explore group_vars and host_vars for managing variables per host or group.
â€¢	Use ansible-playbook command with -e flag to pass variables dynamically.
Ansible Facts and Variables: A Beginner's Guide
Introduction
Ansible is an automation tool that helps manage servers, applications, and configurations. One of its key features is the ability to use variables and facts to make automation dynamic and efficient.
This guide will explain:
â€¢	Ansible Variables
â€¢	Ansible Facts
â€¢	How to use them in Playbooks
â€¢	Examples and Commands
________________________________________
1. Ansible Variables
What are Variables?
Variables in Ansible are placeholders used to store data. This helps avoid hardcoding values and allows dynamic control over configurations.
Rules for Ansible Variables:
â€¢	Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
â€¢	Must start with a letter.
â€¢	Cannot have spaces.
Defining Variables
Variables can be defined in multiple ways:
1.	Inside Playbooks
2.	Inside Inventory Files
3.	Using Command-line Arguments
4.	Inside Separate Variable Files
Example: Defining Variables in a Playbook
- hosts: webservers
  vars:
    env_name: "development"
  tasks:
    - name: Display Environment Name
      debug:
        msg: "The environment is {{ env_name }}"
Using Variables in Tasks
You can use variables inside tasks by enclosing them in {{ }}.
- name: Create a file using a variable
  file:
    path: "/tmp/{{ env_name }}_config.txt"
    state: touch
________________________________________
2. Ansible Facts
What are Ansible Facts?
Ansible Facts are pieces of information automatically gathered about target machines (e.g., OS type, IP address, hostname, etc.).
These facts help in making playbooks dynamic and adaptable.
How to Gather Facts?
â€¢	Facts are collected automatically when running a playbook.
â€¢	You can use the setup module to see all available facts.
Example: Gathering System Facts
ansible all -m setup
This command will display a lot of system-related information such as IP addresses, OS details, CPU info, etc.
Using Specific Facts
You can filter specific facts using the filter argument.
ansible all -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_distribution'
This will return the OS name (e.g., Ubuntu or CentOS).
Example: Using Facts in Playbooks
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Display OS Type
      debug:
        msg: "This server is running {{ ansible_distribution }}"
Disabling Facts Gathering
If you donâ€™t want Ansible to collect facts automatically, set gather_facts: no.
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Print Message
      debug:
        msg: "Facts gathering is disabled!"
________________________________________
3. Comparison Table: Variables vs. Facts
Feature	Ansible Variables	Ansible Facts
Definition	User-defined values	System-generated values
Stored In	Playbooks, inventory, external files	Gathered automatically by Ansible
Usage	Custom configurations	System details like OS, IP, etc.
Defined By	User	Ansibleâ€™s setup module
Example	env_name: "production"	ansible_distribution: "Ubuntu"
________________________________________
4. Using Variables and Facts Together
Example Playbook Combining Variables and Facts
- hosts: all
  vars:
    config_dir: "/etc/configs"
  tasks:
    - name: Create config file using facts and variables
      file:
        path: "{{ config_dir }}/{{ ansible_distribution }}_config.txt"
        state: touch
In this example:
â€¢	config_dir is a user-defined variable.
â€¢	ansible_distribution is an Ansible fact.
â€¢	The result is a file named /etc/configs/Ubuntu_config.txt (or another OS name) created dynamically.
________________________________________
Conclusion
Ansible Variables and Facts make playbooks powerful and flexible:
â€¢	Variables allow you to customize playbooks.
â€¢	Facts provide real-time system information.
â€¢	They can be used together for efficient automation.
By mastering variables and facts, you can build highly adaptable and scalable Ansible playbooks. ðŸš€
