Ansible Galaxy, Playbooks, and Roles - A Beginner's Guide
1. What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It helps system administrators manage multiple servers efficiently.
2. What is Ansible Galaxy?
Ansible Galaxy is a public repository of Ansible roles where users can download pre-built roles or share their own. It helps in speeding up automation by providing reusable configurations.
Example:
Imagine you want to set up MySQL on multiple servers. Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can use an Ansible role from Galaxy to do it automatically.

3. What are Ansible Playbooks?
Playbooks are YAML files that define a set of tasks to automate processes on remote servers. They help in organizing and executing automation steps efficiently.
Example Playbook:
- name: Install Apache Web Server
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
Table: Key Components of a Playbook
Component	Description
name	Description of the playbook
hosts	Defines target servers
become	Runs tasks with admin privileges
tasks	List of automation steps
4. What are Ansible Roles?
Roles are structured directories that help organize playbooks by separating tasks, variables, and configurations into reusable components.
Role Directory Structure:
my_role/
├── defaults/
├── files/
├── handlers/
├── meta/
├── tasks/
├── templates/
├── vars/
•	tasks/ → Contains YAML files defining automation steps.
•	handlers/ → Contains handlers that run after task execution.
•	templates/ → Stores Jinja2 template files.
Example Role Task File (tasks/main.yml)
- name: Install MySQL
  apt:
    name: mysql-server
    state: present
5. How to Use Ansible Galaxy?
You can download and install roles using the command:
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.mysql
To use a downloaded role in a playbook:
- name: Apply MySQL Role
  hosts: db_servers
  roles:
    - geerlingguy.mysql
6. Managing Multiple Roles with Requirements File
You can define multiple roles in a requirements.yml file:
- name: geerlingguy.java
- name: geerlingguy.nginx
Then, install them with:
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
Conclusion
•	Ansible Galaxy provides pre-built roles.
•	Playbooks define automation tasks.
•	Roles help organize configurations.
•	Using ansible-galaxy, you can download and use roles efficiently.
With this knowledge, you can start automating tasks in a structured and reusable way!
