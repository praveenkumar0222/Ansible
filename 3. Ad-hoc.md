Introduction to Ansible - Basic Study Material
What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It allows users to automate IT infrastructure with simple, human-readable scripts written in YAML.
Core Components of Ansible
1. Inventory
The inventory file is a list of managed hosts stored in a file. This file can be in INI or YAML format. By default, Ansible uses the inventory located at /etc/ansible/hosts.
Example of Inventory File (INI format)
[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[dbservers]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com
In the above example, there are two groups: webservers and dbservers, each containing multiple hosts.
2. Modules
Modules are scripts that perform specific tasks like installing packages, copying files, or restarting services. Each module accepts parameters and returns output in JSON format.
Example of a Module Usage
The following command installs nginx on a remote machine:
ansible all -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present" -b
3. Variables
Variables help in managing system differences and making playbooks dynamic. Variables can be stored in dictionaries or lists.
Example of Variables in Playbooks
vars:
  database_name: mydb
  destination: /etc/config/
Variables can also be grouped based on host or playbook level.
4. Facts
Facts are system information automatically gathered by Ansible. These include OS type, IP addresses, and memory usage.
Example of Fact Gathering
To display facts about a host, run:
ansible all -m setup
5. Playbooks
Playbooks define automation tasks in YAML format. They contain multiple plays that map groups of hosts to specific tasks.
Example of a Simple Playbook
- name: Install and start Apache
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
    - name: Start Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
6. Configuration File
Ansible uses a configuration file (ansible.cfg) to override default settings. The order of configuration file lookup is:
1.	ansible.cfg in the current directory
2.	~/.ansible.cfg in the home directory
3.	/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (default)
Example of an Ansible Configuration File
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
host_key_checking = False
retry_files_enabled = False
7. Ad Hoc Commands
Ad hoc commands are used for executing quick tasks without writing a playbook. They are useful for one-time tasks like checking logs, managing services, or verifying package installations.
Example of an Ad Hoc Command
The following command checks system information on localhost:
ansible localhost -m setup
Difference Between Ad Hoc Commands and Playbooks
Feature	Ad Hoc Command	Playbook
Execution	Single command	YAML script
Use Case	One-time task	Large deployments
Syntax	Command-line	Structured YAML
Commonly Used Modules in Ad Hoc Commands
Module	Purpose
ping	Checks if a server is reachable
setup	Gathers system facts
apt	Manages packages on Ubuntu/Debian
yum	Manages packages on RHEL/CentOS
service	Manages system services
user	Adds or removes users
copy	Copies files to remote systems
Summary Table
Component	Description
Inventory	List of managed hosts (INI/YAML format)
Modules	Predefined tasks executed by Ansible
Variables	Store data dynamically for tasks
Facts	Automatically gathered system information
Playbooks	YAML-based automation scripts
Configuration File	Controls Ansible's default behavior
Ad Hoc Commands	One-time tasks executed via command-line
Conclusion
Ansible simplifies automation using YAML-based playbooks and eliminates the need for manual configuration. Understanding these basic components will help in efficiently managing and automating IT tasks.
Ansible Ad Hoc Commands - Beginner's Guide
What is an Ansible Ad Hoc Command?
Ansible Ad Hoc commands allow you to quickly execute a single task on a remote system without writing a full playbook. These commands are typically used for one-time tasks, such as installing a package, restarting a service, or gathering system information.
When to Use Ad Hoc Commands?
â€¢	When you need to execute a quick task without writing a playbook.
â€¢	Checking system logs or configurations.
â€¢	Installing or removing software packages.
â€¢	Restarting or stopping services.
Syntax of Ansible Ad Hoc Commands
An Ansible Ad Hoc command follows this syntax:
ansible <host-group> -i <inventory-file> -m <module> -a <arguments> [-b]
Where:
â€¢	<host-group>: Specifies the target host(s) from the inventory file.
â€¢	-i <inventory-file>: Specifies the inventory file containing the list of managed hosts.
â€¢	-m <module>: Specifies the module to execute (e.g., apt, yum, service).
â€¢	-a <arguments>: Specifies the module parameters (e.g., package name, service name).
â€¢	-b (optional): Runs the command with elevated privileges (sudo/root access).
Example: Installing a Package
Let's try to install the vim package using the apt module on a local machine.
ansible localhost -m apt -a "name=vim state=latest" -b
Explanation:
â€¢	localhost: Specifies the target machine.
â€¢	-m apt: Uses the apt module (package manager for Debian-based systems).
â€¢	-a "name=vim state=latest": Installs the latest version of vim.
â€¢	-b: Runs the command as a privileged user (root).
Expected Output:
If the package is installed successfully, Ansible will return a success message. If vim is already installed, Ansible will skip the step and show no changes.
Example: Removing a Package
If we want to remove vim, we change the state to absent:
ansible localhost -m apt -a "name=vim state=absent" -b
Expected Output:
Ansible will confirm that the package has been removed.
Handling Permissions with -b (Become)
If you try to install or remove a package without root privileges, Ansible will return an error. To fix this, we use the -b flag to execute the command as root.
ansible localhost -m apt -a "name=vim state=latest" -b
This allows Ansible to perform administrative tasks without switching users manually.
Summary Table
Command	Description
ansible localhost -m apt -a "name=vim state=latest" -b	Installs the vim package
ansible localhost -m apt -a "name=vim state=absent" -b	Removes the vim package
ansible localhost -m service -a "name=nginx state=started" -b	Starts the nginx service
ansible localhost -m ping	Checks if the host is reachable
By using Ad Hoc commands, you can quickly perform system administration tasks without writing long playbooks. For more complex automation, consider using Ansible Playbooks.
Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands - Study Material
What is an Ansible Ad-Hoc Command?
An Ansible ad-hoc command is a simple, one-time command used to perform quick administrative tasks on remote servers. Unlike playbooks, which are reusable scripts, ad-hoc commands are used for immediate execution of tasks without writing a full script.
When to Use Ad-Hoc Commands?
â€¢	Checking system logs
â€¢	Restarting services
â€¢	Installing or removing software
â€¢	Gathering system information
â€¢	Managing files and users
Syntax of an Ansible Ad-Hoc Command
ansible <host_group> -i <inventory_file> -m <module> -a "<module_arguments>" [-b]
Explanation of Syntax
â€¢	<host_group>: The target server(s) where the command will run.
â€¢	-i <inventory_file>: Specifies the inventory file containing server details.
â€¢	-m <module>: Defines the module to use (e.g., apt, file, ping).
â€¢	-a "<module_arguments>": Provides arguments to the module.
â€¢	-b: Runs the command with sudo privileges if required.
Example Commands
1. Checking if a Server is Reachable
ansible all -m ping
Output:
{"ping": "pong"}
2. Installing a Package (Example: vim)
ansible localhost -m apt -a "name=vim state=latest" -b
This installs the latest version of vim on the target system.
3. Removing a Package
ansible localhost -m apt -a "name=vim state=absent" -b
This removes vim from the system.
4. Creating a File
ansible localhost -m file -a "path=./example.txt state=touch"
Creates an empty file example.txt in the current directory.
5. Deleting a File
ansible localhost -m file -a "path=./example.txt state=absent"
Removes the example.txt file.
Difference Between Ad-Hoc Commands and Playbooks
Feature	Ad-Hoc Command	Playbook
Execution	One-time task	Reusable script
Flexibility	Simple and quick	More structured and automated
Best for	Quick tasks	Large-scale automation
File Permissions Example
When creating a file, you can set permissions using the mode parameter:
ansible localhost -m file -a "path=./secure.txt state=touch mode=0444"
This creates a file with read-only permissions.
Summary
â€¢	Ansible ad-hoc commands are useful for quick tasks.
â€¢	They use modules like apt, file, ping, etc.
â€¢	Commands can install, remove packages, manage files, and check system status.
â€¢	They are different from playbooks, which are reusable scripts.
This material provides a fundamental understanding of Ansible ad-hoc commands with examples. ðŸš€
