## **1. Introduction to Advanced Ansible Tower (AWX) Techniques**

### **What are Advanced Techniques?**
Advanced techniques in Ansible Tower (AWX) include workflow automation, integration with CI/CD pipelines, and using the REST API for automation.

### **Why Use Advanced Techniques?**
- **Efficiency**: Automate complex workflows and reduce manual intervention.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines.
- **Scalability**: Use the REST API to manage and scale automation tasks.

---

## **2. Workflow Automation**

### **Creating Workflow Templates**
Workflow templates allow you to chain multiple job templates together to create complex automation workflows.

### **Example: Multi-Step Deployment Workflow**
1. **Create Job Templates**:
   - **Provision Infrastructure**: Job template to provision infrastructure.
   - **Deploy Application**: Job template to deploy the application.
   - **Run Tests**: Job template to run tests.

2. **Create Workflow Template**:
   - **Add Nodes**: Add the job templates as nodes in the workflow.
   - **Define Dependencies**: Define dependencies between nodes (e.g., run tests after deployment).

3. **Run Workflow**: Execute the workflow to automate the entire deployment process.

---

## **3. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**

### **Integrating with Jenkins**
1. **Install Jenkins**: Set up Jenkins on your server.
2. **Install Ansible Plugin**: Install the Ansible plugin in Jenkins.
3. **Create Jenkins Job**: Create a Jenkins job to trigger Ansible Tower job templates.

### **Example: CI/CD Pipeline with Ansible Tower**
1. **Source Code Change**: A developer pushes code to the Git repository.
2. **Jenkins Build**: Jenkins triggers a build and runs unit tests.
3. **Ansible Tower Job**: Jenkins triggers an Ansible Tower job to deploy the application.
4. **Run Tests**: Ansible Tower runs integration tests.
5. **Deploy to Production**: If tests pass, deploy to production.

---

## **4. Using the REST API**

### **Overview of the REST API**
The REST API allows you to programmatically manage Ansible Tower, including creating and running jobs, managing inventories, and more.

### **Example: Automating Job Execution via API**
1. **Get API Token**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -u username:password https://tower.example.com/api/v2/tokens/
   ```
2. **Run Job Template**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"extra_vars": {"var1": "value1"}}' https://tower.example.com/api/v2/job_templates/<id>/launch/
   ```

---

## **5. Best Practices for Advanced Techniques**

### **Organizing Workflows**
- **Logical Grouping**: Organize workflows logically (e.g., by environment, application).
- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming conventions for workflows and job templates.

### **Securing API Access**
- **API Tokens**: Use API tokens for authentication and limit their scope.
- **Role-Based Access**: Restrict API access based on roles.

### **Monitoring and Logging**
- **Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools to track the performance of workflows.
- **Logging**: Enable logging to capture detailed information about job executions.

---

## **6. Conclusion and Next Steps**

### **What We Learned**
- **Workflow Automation**: Creating and managing workflow templates.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrating Ansible Tower with Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines.
- **REST API**: Using the REST API to automate job execution.
- **Best Practices**: Organizing workflows, securing API access, and monitoring.

### **Next Steps**
- **Day 11**: Using Ansible for configuration management and deployment.
- **Day 12**: Advanced playbook techniques, including using `set_fact` and `register`.

### **Example Workflow Template**

### **Example CI/CD Pipeline**
```yaml
- name: CI/CD Pipeline with Ansible Tower
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Trigger Jenkins Build
      uri:
        url: "http://jenkins.example.com/job/build/buildWithParameters"
        method: POST
        user: "jenkins_user"
        password: "jenkins_password"
        body: "{}"
        status_code: 201

    - name: Trigger Ansible Tower Job
      uri:
        url: "https://tower.example.com/api/v2/job_templates/1/launch/"
        method: POST
        headers:
          Authorization: "Bearer <token>"
        body: "{}"
        status_code: 201
```

### **Example REST API Call**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"extra_vars": {"var1": "value1"}}' https://tower.example.com/api/v2/job_templates/<id>/launch/
```
