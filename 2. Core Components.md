Introduction to Ansible - Basic Study Material
What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It allows users to automate IT infrastructure with simple, human-readable scripts written in YAML.
Core Components of Ansible
1. Inventory
The inventory file is a list of managed hosts stored in a file. This file can be in INI or YAML format. By default, Ansible uses the inventory located at /etc/ansible/hosts.
Example of Inventory File (INI format)
[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[dbservers]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com
In the above example, there are two groups: webservers and dbservers, each containing multiple hosts.
2. Modules
Modules are scripts that perform specific tasks like installing packages, copying files, or restarting services. Each module accepts parameters and returns output in JSON format.
Example of a Module Usage
The following command installs nginx on a remote machine:
ansible all -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present" -b
3. Variables
Variables help in managing system differences and making playbooks dynamic. Variables can be stored in dictionaries or lists.
Example of Variables in Playbooks
vars:
  database_name: mydb
  destination: /etc/config/
Variables can also be grouped based on host or playbook level.
4. Facts
Facts are system information automatically gathered by Ansible. These include OS type, IP addresses, and memory usage.
Example of Fact Gathering
To display facts about a host, run:
ansible all -m setup
5. Playbooks
Playbooks define automation tasks in YAML format. They contain multiple plays that map groups of hosts to specific tasks.
Example of a Simple Playbook
- name: Install and start Apache
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
    - name: Start Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
6. Configuration File
Ansible uses a configuration file (ansible.cfg) to override default settings. The order of configuration file lookup is:
1.	ansible.cfg in the current directory
2.	~/.ansible.cfg in the home directory
3.	/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (default)
Example of an Ansible Configuration File
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
host_key_checking = False
retry_files_enabled = False
Summary Table
Component	Description
Inventory	List of managed hosts (INI/YAML format)
Modules	Predefined tasks executed by Ansible
Variables	Store data dynamically for tasks
Facts	Automatically gathered system information
Playbooks	YAML-based automation scripts
Configuration File	Controls Ansible's default behavior
Conclusion
Ansible simplifies automation using YAML-based playbooks and eliminates the need for manual configuration. Understanding these basic components will help in efficiently managing and automating IT tasks.
