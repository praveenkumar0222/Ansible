Ansible Inventory - Beginner's Guide
What is Ansible Inventory?
Ansible Inventory is a file that keeps a list of all the servers (also called hosts) that Ansible manages. It tells Ansible where to run commands and playbooks.
Purpose of Inventory
â€¢	It helps in managing multiple servers efficiently.
â€¢	Defines groups of servers based on their roles.
â€¢	Stores server-specific or group-specific variables.
â€¢	Supports static (fixed) and dynamic (changing) inventories.
Types of Inventory
1. Static Inventory
â€¢	A manually created file with a fixed list of servers.
â€¢	Stored in INI or YAML format.
â€¢	Requires manual updates when new servers are added or removed.
Example (INI Format)
[webservers]
server1.example.com
server2.example.com

[dbservers]
server3.example.com
Example (YAML Format)
all:
  hosts:
    server1.example.com:
    server2.example.com:
  children:
    webservers:
      hosts:
        server1.example.com:
        server2.example.com:
    dbservers:
      hosts:
        server3.example.com:
2. Dynamic Inventory
â€¢	Generated automatically by querying external sources like AWS, Azure, or databases.
â€¢	Useful for cloud environments where IPs change frequently.
â€¢	Requires a script (Python, Bash, etc.) to fetch the latest server list.
Example (Dynamic Inventory using AWS EC2)
{
  "webservers": {
    "hosts": ["ec2-34-123-45-67.compute-1.amazonaws.com"],
    "vars": {
      "ansible_ssh_user": "ubuntu"
    }
  }
}
Difference Between Static and Dynamic Inventory
Feature	Static Inventory	Dynamic Inventory
Format	INI, YAML	JSON, Script-based
Updates	Manual	Automatic
Best for	Small infrastructures	Large, dynamic environments
Example Use Case	Fixed servers in a data center	Cloud-based servers with changing IPs
Inventory File Location
â€¢	Default location: /etc/ansible/hosts
â€¢	Custom location can be specified using -i flag: 
â€¢	ansible -i my_inventory.ini all -m ping
Grouping Servers in Inventory
â€¢	Servers can be grouped based on roles like web servers, database servers, etc.
Example
[webservers]
server1.example.com
server2.example.com

[dbservers]
server3.example.com

[all_servers:children]
webservers
dbservers
Using Variables in Inventory
â€¢	Variables store extra information like SSH user, ports, or custom settings.
Example
[webservers]
server1.example.com ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu ansible_port=22
Best Practices
1.	Use Groups Wisely: Organize servers into groups for easier management.
2.	Store Variables Separately: Keep variables in group_vars/ and host_vars/ instead of the inventory file.
3.	Use Dynamic Inventory for Cloud Environments: Helps in automatic server management.
Conclusion
Ansible Inventory is a critical part of Ansible automation. It helps in managing multiple servers effectively, whether they are static or dynamic. Understanding its structure and best practices ensures smooth infrastructure management with Ansible.
Dynamic Inventory in Ansible
What is Dynamic Inventory?
Ansible's Dynamic Inventory is a way to automatically fetch real-time infrastructure details rather than manually maintaining a static inventory file. It allows Ansible to gather host information dynamically from various sources such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, OpenStack, and more.
Why Use Dynamic Inventory?
â€¢	Automates inventory management, reducing manual updates.
â€¢	Useful for cloud environments where hosts frequently change (e.g., auto-scaling instances in AWS).
â€¢	Ensures accuracy in host details at runtime.
________________________________________
How Dynamic Inventory Works
Unlike Static Inventory (which is manually defined in a file), Dynamic Inventory is generated using an executable script or plugin that fetches hosts from an external system (like AWS, OpenStack, etc.).
Key Characteristics:
â€¢	Executable Scripts: Must return host information in JSON format.
â€¢	Works in Real-time: Always fetches updated inventory when the playbook runs.
â€¢	Supports Various Formats: Scripts can be written in Python, Ruby, Bash, Go, etc.
â€¢	Supports Filters: Can fetch details for all hosts or specific ones.
________________________________________
Example of Dynamic Inventory Script
A dynamic inventory script should follow Ansibleâ€™s expected JSON format. Below is a simple Python example:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json

def get_inventory():
    inventory = {
        "web_servers": {
            "hosts": ["192.168.1.10", "192.168.1.11"],
            "vars": {"ansible_user": "ubuntu"}
        },
        "db_servers": {
            "hosts": ["192.168.1.20"],
            "vars": {"ansible_user": "admin"}
        },
        "_meta": {"hostvars": {}}
    }
    print(json.dumps(inventory))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_inventory()
Steps to Use This Script:
1.	Save the script as dynamic_inventory.py.
2.	Make it executable: 
3.	chmod +x dynamic_inventory.py
4.	Run the script to test output: 
5.	./dynamic_inventory.py
This should return JSON output with host details.
6.	Use it with Ansible: 
7.	ansible -i dynamic_inventory.py all --list-hosts
________________________________________
Dynamic Inventory with Cloud Providers
Ansible provides pre-built dynamic inventory plugins for cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
Cloud Provider	Plugin Name
AWS	amazon.aws.ec2
Azure	azure.azcollection.azure_rm
Google Cloud	google.cloud.gcp_compute
OpenStack	openstack.cloud.openstack
Example: AWS Dynamic Inventory
To use AWS dynamic inventory:
1.	Install the required collection: 
2.	ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
3.	Configure AWS credentials (~/.aws/credentials).
4.	Use AWS inventory plugin: 
5.	ansible-inventory -i aws_ec2.yml --list
AWS Inventory File Example (aws_ec2.yml):
plugin: amazon.aws.ec2
regions:
  - us-east-1
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags.Name
    prefix: instance
________________________________________
Running Playbooks with Dynamic Inventory
Once the dynamic inventory script or plugin is set up, you can use it in playbooks:
ansible-playbook -i dynamic_inventory.py site.yml
Or for AWS:
ansible-playbook -i aws_ec2.yml site.yml
________________________________________
Summary
â€¢	Dynamic Inventory allows Ansible to fetch real-time host details from external sources.
â€¢	It is useful for cloud environments where servers frequently change.
â€¢	Scripts should return JSON-formatted output for Ansible.
â€¢	Ansible provides pre-built plugins for cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
Using Dynamic Inventory makes infrastructure management efficient, scalable, and automated. ðŸš€
Using Inventory Variables in Ansible
What are Inventory Variables?
In Ansible, inventory variables are used to store information related to hosts or groups of hosts. These variables help manage configurations dynamically without modifying playbooks directly.
Why Use Inventory Variables?
â€¢	To store reusable data for hosts/groups.
â€¢	To simplify playbooks by avoiding hardcoded values.
â€¢	To make automation flexible and maintainable.
________________________________________
Inventory Structure
Example Inventory File (INI Format)
[tomcat]
localhost
Group Variables File (group_vars/tomcat.yml)
tomcat_port: 8080
Host Variables File (host_vars/localhost.yml)
host_name: localhost
Here:
â€¢	The inventory file defines a group called tomcat with one host (localhost).
â€¢	The group variables file (group_vars/tomcat.yml) defines tomcat_port as 8080.
â€¢	The host variables file (host_vars/localhost.yml) defines host_name as localhost.
________________________________________
Running Commands with Variables
You can use Ansible ad-hoc commands to retrieve variables.
Check a Variableâ€™s Value:
ansible tomcat -i inventory -m debug -a "msg={{ tomcat_port }}"
Output:
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "msg": "8080"
}
This confirms that the tomcat_port variable is correctly fetched from the group_vars file.
________________________________________
Creating a File Using Variables
We can create a file and write variable values into it using Ansible's file module.
Command to Create a File:
ansible localhost -i inventory -m copy -a "content='Port: {{ tomcat_port }}' dest=/tmp/tomcat_config.txt"
Verify File Content:
cat /tmp/tomcat_config.txt
Output:
Port: 8080
________________________________________
Modifying a File Attribute Using Variables
To modify a file, we can use Ansibleâ€™s file module.
Example Command:
ansible localhost -i inventory -m file -a "path=/tmp/tomcat_config.txt owner=root mode=0644"
This changes the file ownership and permissions dynamically.
________________________________________
Conclusion
â€¢	Inventory variables help manage configurations dynamically.
â€¢	Variables can be defined at host or group level.
â€¢	Ansible ad-hoc commands can be used to retrieve and apply variables.
â€¢	Playbooks and modules like copy and file make use of inventory variables for automation.
By structuring inventory properly and using variables effectively, you can simplify your Ansible automation setup!
Ansible Dynamic Inventory Using a Script
Introduction
Ansible uses an inventory to track the hosts it manages. A static inventory contains a fixed list of hosts, while a dynamic inventory retrieves the list of hosts dynamically from an external source, such as a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.). This allows Ansible to manage hosts that are automatically added or removed.
One common way to create a dynamic inventory is by using a script. In this guide, we will discuss how to set up and use a script for dynamic inventory in Ansible.
________________________________________
What is a Dynamic Inventory Script?
A dynamic inventory script is an executable file that generates an inventory dynamically. The script must output JSON format, which Ansible can understand.
Why Use a Dynamic Inventory?
â€¢	Automatically discovers hosts without manually updating the inventory file.
â€¢	Useful for cloud environments where servers are frequently created and destroyed.
â€¢	Reduces human errors and simplifies infrastructure management.
________________________________________
Setting Up a Dynamic Inventory Script
Step 1: Creating the Script
We will create a Python script named dynamic.py to fetch AWS EC2 instances as an inventory.
Example: A Basic Dynamic Inventory Script
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json

inventory = {
    "all": {
        "hosts": ["ec2-34-201-120-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com"],
        "vars": {
            "ansible_user": "ubuntu",
            "ansible_ssh_private_key_file": "~/.ssh/aws-key.pem"
        }
    }
}

print(json.dumps(inventory))
Step 2: Making the Script Executable
To run the script, it must be executable. Use the following command:
chmod +x dynamic.py
Step 3: Running the Script Manually
Test the script by running:
./dynamic.py
Expected Output:
{
    "all": {
        "hosts": ["ec2-34-201-120-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com"],
        "vars": {
            "ansible_user": "ubuntu",
            "ansible_ssh_private_key_file": "~/.ssh/aws-key.pem"
        }
    }
}
________________________________________
Using the Dynamic Inventory in Ansible
Step 4: Running an Ansible Command Using the Dynamic Inventory
Now, we can use our script as an inventory source for Ansible:
ansible all -i dynamic.py -m ping
Step 5: Running a Playbook with a Dynamic Inventory
To run a playbook using the dynamic inventory:
ansible-playbook -i dynamic.py playbook.yml
________________________________________
Diagram: Static vs. Dynamic Inventory
Feature	Static Inventory	Dynamic Inventory
Definition	Fixed list of hosts	Hosts fetched dynamically
Maintenance	Manual updates needed	Automatically updates
Use Case	Small, fixed servers	Cloud-based, frequently changing servers
________________________________________
Conclusion
A dynamic inventory script is an essential tool for managing cloud-based infrastructure with Ansible. It automatically discovers and updates the list of hosts, reducing manual work and ensuring that the inventory remains up to date.
By using an executable script like dynamic.py, we can integrate external sources such as AWS, GCP, or databases to fetch hosts dynamically and use them in Ansible automation.
Now, you can implement dynamic inventories in your Ansible projects and manage hosts more efficiently! ðŸš€
